# Images

Prism supports including images in your messages for vision analysis for most providers.

See the [provider support table](/getting-started/introduction.html#provider-support) to check whether Prism supports your chosen provider.

Note however that provider support may differ by model. If you receive error messages with a provider that Prism indicates is supported, check the provider's documentation as to whether the model you are using supports images.

For other media types like videos, audio files, and YouTube videos, see the [Media documentation](/input-modalities/media.html).

## Getting started

To add an image to your prompt, use the `withPrompt` method with an `Image` value object:

```php
use Prism\Prism\Prism;
use Prism\Prism\Enums\Provider;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Media\Image;

// From a local path
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt(
        "What's in this image?",
        [Image::fromLocalPath(path: '/path/to/image.jpg')]
    )
    ->asText();

// From a path on a storage disk
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt(
        "What's in this image?",
        [Image::fromStoragePath(
            path: '/path/to/image.jpg', 
            disk: 'my-disk' // optional - omit/null for default disk
        )]
    )
    ->asText();

// From a URL
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt(
        'Analyze this diagram:',
        [Image::fromUrl(url: 'https://example.com/diagram.png')]
    )
    ->asText();

// From base64
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt(
        'Analyze this diagram:',
        [Image::fromBase64(base64: base64_encode(file_get_contents('/path/to/image.jpg')))]
    )
    ->asText();

// From raw content
$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withPrompt(
        'Analyze this diagram:',
        [Image::fromRawContent(rawContent: file_get_contents('/path/to/image.jpg'))]
    )
    ->asText();
```

## Alternative: Using withMessages

You can also include images using the message-based approach:

```php
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Messages\UserMessage;
use Prism\Prism\ValueObjects\Media\Image;

$message = new UserMessage(
    "What's in this image?",
    [Image::fromLocalPath(path: '/path/to/image.jpg')]
);

$response = Prism::text()
    ->using(Provider::Anthropic, 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022')
    ->withMessages([$message])
    ->asText();
```

## Transfer mediums 

Providers are not consistent in their support of sending raw contents, base64 and/or URLs (as noted above). 

Prism tries to smooth over these rough edges, but its not always possible.

### Supported conversions
- Where a provider does not support URLs: Prism will fetch the URL and use base64 or rawContent.
- Where you provide a file, base64 or rawContent: Prism will switch between base64 and rawContent depending on what the provider accepts.

### Limitations
- Where a provider only supports URLs: if you provide a file path, raw contents or base64, for security reasons Prism does not create a URL for you and your request will fail.
